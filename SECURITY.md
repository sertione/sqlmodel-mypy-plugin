# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project is currently **early/experimental**.

- We support the **latest released version** of the package.
- For un-released changes, use the `dev` branch.

If you are unsure whether your issue is security-sensitive, treat it as security-sensitive and
report it privately.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security reports.

Instead, report via GitHub Security Advisories:

- https://github.com/sertione/sqlmodel-mypy-plugin/security/advisories/new

Include as much of the following as possible:

- Affected versions and your environment (Python / mypy / sqlmodel versions)
- Clear reproduction steps (ideally a minimal snippet)
- Impact / severity assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- Any suggested fix or mitigation (if you have one)

## Response process

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within **7 days**
- Provide a plan or request more information as needed
- Publish a fix and advisory when appropriate

Timelines may vary depending on complexity and maintainer availability.
